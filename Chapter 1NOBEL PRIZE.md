[**What criteria are you looking for when selecting a Nobel Prize laureate?**](https://www.nobelprize.org/behind-the-scenes-of-the-nobel-prize-in-physiology-or-medicine/)

Alfred Nobel was very clear in his will when he listed the criteria for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He specifically stated he was **looking for a discovery that would have a benefit to humankind** so our criteria is very narrow. 

We’re looking for a **discovery** that **has either opened doors and helped us think about a problem in a new way**, or the **discovery has changed the way we think about a problem** – it’s ==**paradigm shifting**==. 

The height of that discovery should really be quite great. **It can’t be an invention or an improvement**. It has to be a **discovery**, it has to be of a high distinction, and it has to be a **benefit to humankind**. In the science prize awarding bodies this has been interpreted to mean that also basic discoveries that **extend the horizon of human knowledge** in profound ways is always of “benefit to humankind”. Very often those basic discoveries become useful to humankind in more direct ways many years after the award, but at the time we make decisions the immediate practical benefit is sometimes obscure.
